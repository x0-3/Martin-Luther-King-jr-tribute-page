            <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist minister, civil rights activist, and leader in the Civil Rights Movement in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. He is best known for his role in the advancement of civil rights using nonviolent civil disobedience based on his Christian beliefs.</p>
            <p>King was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1929, and grew up in a time when African Americans in the South were subject to discrimination and violence. He became a minister like his father and grandfather before him, and earned a Ph.D. in systematic theology from Boston University.</p>
            <p>In 1955, King was elected president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, which had been formed after the arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. King helped to lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for over a year and resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court declaring segregation on public buses to be unconstitutional. This event was a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement and brought King to national prominence as a leader of the movement.</p>
            <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, King led many more demonstrations and peaceful protests to end racial discrimination and segregation, including the famous March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, where he delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech.</p>
            <p>King's efforts and leadership played a significant role in the Civil Rights Movement and in the passage of Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which helped to end legal segregation and discrimination against African Americans.</p>
            <p>However, he was also criticized by some, who saw his non-violent methods as too slow and gradual, and his opposition to poverty and war, marked him as a controversial figure.</p>
            <p>King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, and his death led to widespread mourning and a wave of riots in cities across the country. His birthday is now celebrated as a national holiday in the United States, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, on the third Monday of January. King's legacy continues to inspire people around the world to work for justice and equality.</p>
